This repo will describe the analyses and main results looking at the effect of Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation on the microbial community of glomeromycetes in corn/soy and wheat. 

Experiment was done in collaboration with Premier Tech and led by Mohamed Hijri. 

Analyses were done by several including Jacynthe Masse. Sebastien Renaut redid some of them (getting Virtual taxa, stat analyses) in June 2018

There are two scripts that describe the analyses and should be self explanatory:

#Rcode
virtual_taxa.R
stats.R


#Figures
figure1_VTX00113.pdf
figure2_OTUabundance.pdf
figure3_alpha.pdf
figure4_pcoa.pdf

#results
most results right now (linear mixed effect models + permanova) are actually in Rcode/stats.R)
