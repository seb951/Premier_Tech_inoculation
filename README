This repo will describe the analyses and main results looking at the effect of Rhizophagus irregulare inoculation on the microbial community of glomeromycetes in corn/soy and wheat. 

Experiment was done in collaboration with Premier Tech and led by Mohamed Hijri. 

Analyses were done by several, mainly Jacynthe Masse. Sebastien Renaut redid most analyses + graphs (getting Virtual taxa, stat analyses) in June 2018

There are several scripts that describe the analyses:

#Rcode
PremierTech_MH_bioinfo.txt #this describes the pipeline to get to an OTU table (it's kind of messy at the moment)
basic_sequencing_stats.R #A few basic stats were calculated here on the raw, trimmed & merged sequencing data

file_description #Check this to see were the temporary files used in the (virtual_taxa.R) and (statistical_analyses.R) originated

virtual_taxa.R #Rcode to get from OTUs to VT (based on the MaarJam database)
statistical_analyses.R #statistical analyses to generate results and figures.

#results
most results right now (linear mixed effect models + permanova) are actually in Rcode/stats.R

r_irregulares_16S.blastout $results of the blast of all VT against the R. irregulare genome.
