Figure 1: Relative abundance of the most abundant Virtual Taxa (VTX00113 represents the R. irregulare DAOM-197198 inoculant, 38% of all reads) in all three species (wheat, Corn, Soy) tested. Species and Growing stage had a significant effect on the presence of VTX00113
Figure 2: Mean relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa and taxonomic information according to the MaarjAM (Opik et al. 2014) database per treatment and species. *VTX00113 represents the R. irregulare DAOM-197198 inoculant.
Figure 3: Mean relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa grouped by genera, order and family according to the MaarjAM (Opik et al. 2014) database per treatment and species.
Figure 4: alpha diversity per treatment, species and growing stage. Species and growing stage had a significant effect on alpha diversity.
