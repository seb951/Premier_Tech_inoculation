Figure 1: Relative abundance of the most abundant Virtual Taxa (VTX00113 representing the Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM-197198 inoculant, 38% of all reads) in all three species (wheat, Corn, Soy) tested. Species and Growing stage had a significant effect on the presence of VTX00113
Figure 4: alpha diversity per Treatment / Species and Growing stage.  Species and Growing stage had a significant effect on alpha diversity
Figure 5: PcoA of the all samples colored coded according to species (wheat, corn, soy). Empty / full circles represent the treatment effect
Figure 6: Redundancy analysis (RDA): only the top10 most abundant VTX are labeled, "Plus" signs represent the centroids of the Species (wheat, corn and soy) and growing stage effect (early vs. late)
Figure 2: mean Relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa and taxonomic information according to the MaarjAM (Opik et al. 2014) database per treatment and species. *VTX00113 represents the Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM-197198 inoculant
Figure 3: mean Relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa grouped by genera, order, family per treatment and species
