Figure 1: Relative abundance of the most abundant Virtual Taxa (VTX00113 representing Rhizophagus irregularis, 33% of all reads) in all three species (wheat, Corn, Soy) tested.
Figure 2: mean Relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa per treatment and species
Figure 3: mean Relative abundance of the Virtual Taxa grouped by genera, order, family per treatment and species
Figure 4: alpha diversity per Treatment / Species and Growing stage
Figure 5: PcoA of the all samples colored coded according to species (wheat, corn, soy). Empty / full circles represent the treatment effect
Figure 6: RDA: VTX are labelled, with Glomus species in Bold. X represent the centroids of the Species (wheat, corn and soy) effect and the growing stage effect (early vs. late)
